                    <h3>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h3>
                    <p>A Human can save the Earth by collecting 10 magic stars. To do so, he shall attempt to beat Alien in SpaceJack by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.</p>
                    <h3>WINS AND LOSES</h3>
                    <p>The winner is a player whose total value of cards is closer or equal 21. After each game the Human will: receive 1 star if won or lose 1 star if defeated. Human have 5 stars in the beginning of the game. The goal is to collect 10 stars in total.</p>
                    <h3>CARD VALUES</h3>
                    <p>Face cards have a value of 10, ace has value of 11 and any other card is its number value.</p>
                    <h3>THE HUMAN'S PLAY</h3>
                    <p>The Human goes first and must decide whether to "check" (end the set by comparing the results with Alien's score) or "draw" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly).</p>
                    <h3>THE ALIEN'S PLAY</h3>
                    <p>When the Alien has served cards for a Human, his second card is face-down. If the total value of Alien's cards is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, he must take a card. Alien must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to SpaceJack - a fun way to practice basic math, memory and decision making skills! The
                        layout and rules are simplified to a child level (4+) while adults can also enjoy the game.</p>
                    <p>SpaceJack is based on the rules of the popular casino game: Blackjack. Although some may believe
                        that this old card game is just a gambling practice - in reality there is a full range of skills
                        this game can teach us:</p>
                    <p>Patience: In general card games teach us to remain unflappable and calm. Mastering this skill is
                        extremely important these days as society becomes more and more impatient. Undoubtful, learning
                        how to use strategy planning will be useful in school! :)</p>
                    <p>Concentration: another worth practicing skill, closely connected with patience. In the world of
                        distractions, being able to remember and recall information is crucial. This is why the Player
                        has to remember the value of the cards and correctly sum them in order to make a decision about
                        the next step, which leads us to...</p>
                    <p>Decision making: Presented with so much information and enormous range of choices, the decision
                        making skills are very important. In this game, the decision making process is essential. There
                        is also a "luck" factor, as the cards are random. It is a good lesson of life flow, where our
                        control over the universe is limited. Sometimes we win and sometimes we lose. It is important
                        for a child to learn how to lose and understand that this is just another part of life.</p>
